#### Cauchy's Theorem

Let $U$ be an open subset of the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$, and suppose the closed
disk $D$ defined as

$$
D = \{z:|z-z_{0}|\leq r\}
$$

is completely contained in $U$. Let $f: U\to\mathbb{C}$ be a holomorphic function,
and let $\gamma$ be the circle, oriented counterclockwise, forming the boundary of
$D$. Then for every $a$ in the interior of $D$,

$$
f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_{\gamma}\frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz.
$$
